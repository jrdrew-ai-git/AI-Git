# AI Git: Unified Knowledge Provenance Framework for Safe Scaling

[![DOI](https://img.shields.io/badge/DOI-10.17605%2FOSF.IO%2FUFEK5-blue)](https://osf.io/ufek5)

An open framework to prevent **AI model collapse** by mitigating recursive self-training, preserving human-grounded knowledge, and enabling federated provenance controls.

## ðŸ“‘ Abstract
As AI models approach web-scale training and recursive learning risks grow, the danger of model collapseâ€”where models degrade by re-ingesting their own outputsâ€”becomes pressing. **AI Git** introduces a governance and provenance framework designed to:
- Fingerprint outputs across generations using semantic embedding and timewarp techniques.
- Tag and weight human-enriched knowledge to preserve factual anchors.
- Federate provenance checks across labs via cryptographic trust mechanisms.

By combining scalable data pipelines, federated provenance exchange, and human-in-the-loop auditing, AI Git offers a blueprint to prevent recursive collapse and ensure AI remains anchored in verifiable human knowledge.
